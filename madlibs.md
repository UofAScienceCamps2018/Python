## Extension ##
If you have finished the first part of this program and have got it checked over move on to these extensions. 

#### Extension 1 #### 
Make the program say if the users guess is higher or lower than the random number.
#### Extension 2 ####
Now put this program in a loop so the program will automatically restart once if the user selects the wrong answer.(See README.MD for reference on using loops) 
#### Extension 3 #### 
Add lives so the user has 3 guesses for the same random number.

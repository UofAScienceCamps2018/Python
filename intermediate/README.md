# Python Intermediate Assignments

### Task
**Create 2 Python programs: A hangman game, and a rock-paper-scissors game**

For the hangman game, you do not need to make a graphical hanging stick figure. The game will be text-based in the terminal.

For the rock-paper-scissors game, the computer will pick one of [rock, paper, scissors] at random and the user will be prompted to choose one of those options as well, and the winner will be displayed.

### Rules
1. Asking your peers for help is okay, but try not to copy and paste their code
2. If you get any code from peers or online sources, cite your sources
3. Make sure your code is compatible with Python3 (some things you look up will work for Python2 but not Python3)

**General rule of thumb:** If you can explain your code in your own words, that proves that you can understand it

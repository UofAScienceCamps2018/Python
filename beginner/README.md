# Python Beginner Assignments

### Task
**Create 3 Python programs: A dice-roller, number guessing game, and madlibs**

For the dice-roller, the program should pick a number from 1 to 6 randomly and display that number to simulate a dice roll

For the number guessing game, the program should pick a random number within a given limit and ask the user to guess that number, telling them if they are correct or not

For the madlibs program, the program should ask the user for certain types of words (verbs, adverbs, adjectives, nouns, etc) to use to make a short story (approx. 3 sentences is recommended but the length is up to you)


### Rules
1. Asking your peers for help is okay, but try not to copy and paste their code
2. If you get any code from peers or online sources, cite your sources
3. Make sure your code is compatible with Python3 (some things you look up will work for Python2 but not Python3)

**General rule of thumb:** If you can explain your code in your own words, that proves that you can understand it


### Code formatting
Examples has been provided to you in this repository ([dice.py](https://github.com/UofAScienceCamps2018/Python/blob/master/beginner/dice.py), [guess.py](https://github.com/UofAScienceCamps2018/Python/blob/master/beginner/guess.py), [madlibs.py](https://github.com/UofAScienceCamps2018/Python/blob/master/beginner/madlibs.py))
